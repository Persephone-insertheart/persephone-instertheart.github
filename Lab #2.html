<h1> Origami</h1>
  <br>
  <h2> History</h2>
  <h3> The history of recreational origami</h3>
  <p>It is not certain when play-made paper models, now commonly known as origami,<span> began in Japan.</span> However,
    the kozuka
    of a Japanese sword made by Gotō Eijō (後藤栄乗) between the end of the <span> 1500s</span> and the beginning of the
    1600s was
    decorated with a picture of a crane made of origami, and it is believed that origami for play existed by the
    <span>Sengoku
      period or the early Edo period. </span>[11]

    In <span>1747</span>, during the Edo period,<span> book titled Ranma zushiki</span> (欄間図式) was published, which
    contained
    various designs of
    the ranma (ja:欄間), an decoration of Japanese architecture.<span> This included origami of various designs</span>,
    including paper
    models of cranes, which are still well known today, and it is thought that by this time, many people were familiar
    with origami for play, which modern people recognize as origami. During this period, origami was commonly called
    <span> orikata</span> (折形) or orisue (折据) and was often <span>used as a pattern on kimonos and
      decorations.</span>[11]

  <h2> Modern Day</h2>
  <h3> How Origami is today</h3>
  <p>Modern origami has attracted a worldwide following, with ever more intricate designs and<span> new techniques.</span> One of
    these techniques is <span>'wet-folding,'</span> the practice of dampening the paper somewhat during folding to allow
    the finished
    product to hold shape better. Variations such as <span>modular origami, also known as unit origami, is a process where
    many origami units are assembled to form an often decorative whole.</span>

    <span>Complex origami</span> models normally <span>require thin, strong paper or tissue foil for successful folding. These lightweight
    materials allow for more layers before the model becomes impractically thick.</span> Modern origami has broken free from
    the traditional linear construction techniques of the past, and <span>models are now frequently wet-folded or constructed
    from materials other than paper and foil.</span> With popularity, a new generation of origami creators has experimented
    with crinkling techniques and smooth-flowing designs used in creating realistic masks, animals, and other
    traditional artistic themes.</p>
