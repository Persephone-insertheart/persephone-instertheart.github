	<p>	The 4 panel self portrait is probably the most satisfying to look at out of them all. The color scheme gives very much spring brunch vibes. The face that I was making sums me up in one picture. Those images and colors definitely capture my personality and I feel like it's a very accurate depiction of me.

	<p>The way I made this project was with layer masking, The healing tool, scaling, and using other things that were made available to me through photopia. I decided to use light brown almond eyes, plumish lips that I sized down to look more like mine, and I used the nose and hair from the original picture. No, I personally don't think that this picture looks like me. I tried to make it real and they look exactly as I do but then when I realized it wasn't working out I remembered that not all of Picasso's pieces are really realistic so I decided to spice it up by adding an extra pair of lips and another eye in a different place. </p>

	<p>I decided to do a logo that represents me as a person because I felt like it would be the simplest thing to do. I only included my name and a rose because a rose can have multiple meanings based on what type of rose and what you believe in. I decided to use the drop shadow on my name to make it pop and show that i'm not as simple as i may seem during the first 3 minutes of meeting me.</p>

<h2> Artist statement </h2>
	<p>I made this project by using illustrator to create my design then I put it all over my artboard and added colors. I turned my design into a deformed dog because I felt like it looked like that. I used the purples, blues, and pink to color it because that is what I felt in the moment and I wanted to display that in my art work with that manner.

<h2> Artist statement </h2>
<p>This project I named “The Ancient Dance of The Sea”  Shows 5 dancers dancing along with the waves and motion that the sea gives. They are dancing to an ancient song of the aquatic drum in early 700bc hiding from historical civilization. I used the pen tool to draw the people and the paintbrush tool to add the water. The water isn't supposed to be as realistic for the fact that the story comes from an ancient mystical place.
